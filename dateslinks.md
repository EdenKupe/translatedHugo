# Worldcons & Related Dates
The **World Science Fiction Convention** (Worldcon) is an annual event that moves to a different location every year. Members of the **World Science Fiction Society** (WSFS) nominate and vote works for the **Hugo**, **Astounding**, and **Lodestar** awards, which are presented at Worldcon, and also vote on bids to host future Worldcons. Attending members can also attend the **Business Meetings** (BM), where changes to the WSFS constitution are proposed, discussed, and voted on. Note that attending membership can be virtual or in person, and also that there is a category of "supporting" membership that allows you to nominate and vote for the awards, but not, currently, for Business Meeting matters.

Adding a Hugo for Translated Speculative fiction will require formally proposing it for a Business Meeting agenda, having enough supporting votes to pass when it comes up, and then ratifying the amendment at the following year's business meeting.

## Seattle in 2025
The Translated Hugo Initiative is **not** proposing anything at the 2025 Business Meeting. Some of our members are attending the [**Seattle Worldcon**](https://seattlein2025.org/), and we encourage working group members and supporters of the the initiative to attend the online business meetings if possible, to become familiar with the process. We also generally encourage speculative fiction fans to participate in the Hugo nominating and voting process, and to participate in Worldcon if you are interested and able: it is a volunteer-run and community-supported event and award.

**Seattle Dates:**
* **Convention:** August 13-17, 2025
* **Awards:**
    * Nominating period: February 10 - March 14
    * Voting period: April 23 - July 23
    * Awards presented: August 16
* **Business Meetings:** In a hopefully-permament move, Worldcon is now holding most of it's business meetings virtually, before the convention takes place, so that members don't have to decide between lengthy parliamentary meetings and all the fun stuff they traveled for. There are a few other reforms being discussed, but the virtual are business meetings are a big step towards allowing more members to participate.
    * Virtual Town Hall: May 25 [(video available)](https://youtu.be/CQ9QA-yBaYo?si=gMG7J0LN7B6li2kE)
    * Tech Test Period: Tuesday July 1, 7-10am & 3-6pm PDT
    * Preliminary Business Meeting: Friday, July 4, 9am–12:30pm PDT
    * First Main Business Meeting: Sunday, July 13, 9am–12:30pm PDT
    * Second Main Business Meeting: Saturday, July 19, 9am–12:30pm PDT

## Los Angeles in 2026
We will likely be beginning the formal process of proposing a Hugo for Translated Speculative Fiction at the business meetings of [**LAcon V**](https://www.lacon.org/), the 2026 Worldcon. (Because each Worldcon is hosted by a rotating, independent group each year, many of them have individual names such as "LAcon" or "Chicon".) The Translated Hugo Working Group will be asking our supporters to come to these business meetings if we do propose it at that time. Los Angeles, one of the most [linguistically diverse cities](https://strommeninc.com/how-many-languages-are-spoken-in-los-angeles/) in America, is a great place to be discussing this.

**Los Angeles Dates:**
* **Convention:** August 27-31, 2026
* **Awards:**
    * Nominating period: tbd, spring 2026
    * Voting period: tbd, spring-summer 2026
    * Awards presented: August 30
* **Business Meetings:** tbd

## Montréal in 2027 (presumably)
While it is not yet formally selected, Montréal is currently [the only bid city](https://bid.montreal2027.ca/en-ca/) for 2027, so it is extremely likely that it will host Worldcon. We definitely plan on asking supporters to help us out in 2027, for either the initial or ratifying phase of the proposal. We're very excited at the prospect of talking about translated speculative fiction in polylingual Quebec, which has [its own tradition](https://wordswithoutborders.org/read/article/2024-02/thriving-on-indiscipline-an-introduction-to-quebecs-science-fiction-and-fantasy-scene-hannah-allen-shim/) of speculative genre work.

**Montréal Dates:**
* **Convention:** September 2-26, 2027
* **Awards:**
    * Nominating period: tbd, spring 2027
    * Voting period: tbd, spring-summer 2027
    * Awards presented: September 5
* **Business Meetings:** tbd
