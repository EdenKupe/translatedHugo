We'll be adding more here over time, but for now check out:
* Our [**eligibility information**](/eligexam), with lists of eligible work to show how much is out there, and other kinds of highlights
* Useful [**links**](/links) about speculative fiction in translation, the initiative, and the awards.
* Ideas for [**panels**](/panels) that can be shared, submitted, or modified to bring help bring translated SF into more convention & conference conversations.
* [Periodically updated coverage](/coverage), listing reviews, podcasts, interviews, essays, and other articles, to demonstrate that translated SF is being read and discussed
* We're working on putting together some book lists, shareable graphics, and more, that hopefully can be of use to booksellers, librarians, and others.
