One resource we'd like to offer is a selection of **panel ideas**. Thinking up, sorting through, and succinctly describing panels is an activity that convention & conference organizers spend a lot of time and energy on, and what panels ultimately show up on programming obviously affect which topics are discussed.

So, we'll be gathering ideas for panels about or including speculative fiction in translation that can be shared, modified, and submitted to cons. We're also planning include some lists of translated titles by theme, to make them easier to reference.

While we put some of these together, if you have an idea for a panel about global or translated SF that you'd like to contribute: [**send it to us using this form!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBKQ24Tk3fZPD2P4qYdaDVME46i-awOOO2zzaN4DjmBRg-xQ/viewform?usp=header)
