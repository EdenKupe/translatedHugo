On these pages, we're going to share: 
* Some extremely abbreviated historical highlights of translated speculative fiction, to give a sense of how important world SF has been to date
* Lists of works that would be eligible for our proposed Hugo, to show that there are enough titles to support a robust category
    * [2024](/elig2024)
    * [2025](/elig2025)
    * [2026](/elig2026)
* A few "hypothetical ballots" demonstrating the range & strength of currently available translated SF, with clips & links to demonstrate that people are reading and discussing these works
* [Periodically updated coverage](/coverage), listing reviews, podcasts, interviews, essays, and other articles, to demonstrate that translated SF is being read and discussed
  
If you'd like to suggest a recent or forthcoming title to add to our lists, please do so using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe4aO1Kgh5KTBdDk-MbYUKYIEbyFWe5w2SFReP-JmZKotCwTQ/viewform?usp=header).
