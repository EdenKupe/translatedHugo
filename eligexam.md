On these pages, we're going to share: 
* Some extremely abbreviated historical highlights of translated speculative fiction, to give a sense of how important world SF has been to date
* Lists of works that would hypothetically be eligible for our proposed Hugo, to show that there are enough titles to support a robust category
* A few "hypothetical ballots" demonstrating the range & strength of currently available translated SF, with clips & links to demonstrate that people are reading and discusisng these works
