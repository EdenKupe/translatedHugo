On these pages, we're going to share: 
* Some extremely abbreviated historical highlights of translated speculative fiction, to give a sense of how important world SF has been to date
* Lists of works that would hypothetically be eligible for our proposed Hugo, to show that there are enough titles to support a robust category
    * [2024](eligexam)
    * 2025
    * 2026
* A few "hypothetical ballots" demonstrating the range & strength of currently available translated SF, with clips & links to demonstrate that people are reading and discusisng these works

If you'd like to suggest a recent or forthcoming title to add to our lists, please do so using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe4aO1Kgh5KTBdDk-MbYUKYIEbyFWe5w2SFReP-JmZKotCwTQ/viewform?usp=header).
