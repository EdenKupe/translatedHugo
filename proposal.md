**Please note: these documents are in a very early stage, and will be revised repeatedly before they are submitted to a future WSFS Business Meeting; the proposal itself is not currently in the final language or format it will need to be in.**

# Proposed Amendment

Moved, to amend the WSFS constitution for the purpose of creating a new Hugo Award category for Best Translated Work by inserting a new subsection in Section 3.3 as follows:

3.3.#: Best Translated Work: A translated book-length work of science fiction or fantasy originally published in a language other than English, with a length of 17,500 words or more.

# Commentary

*The commentary will be a fairly brief statement explaining the proposal further, which will be presented along with the proposal for WSFS members to consider. The working group will be workshopping a version of that and sharing here when complete; you can get a pretty good feel for what we're going to say based on the [home page](/[root](https://translatedhugo.org/)), ["Why A Translated Award?"](/why-award), and our [FAQ](/faq). In addition to making a hopefuly-compelling argument, we'll make a few clarifications, such as underscoring the importance of recognizing the translator.*
