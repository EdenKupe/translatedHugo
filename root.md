# It's time to recognize Global SF #

Speculative fiction—including science fiction, fantasy, and related genres—is a global phenomenon. There is a wealth of communities and organizations creating and celebrating SF around the world, and yet, within English-speaking circles, there are no major awards highlighting translated speculative fiction.

The Translated Hugo Initiative wants to change that, by introducing a Hugo Award for Best Translated Work. The Hugos are the annual awards bestowed by the World Science Fiction Society, and generally recognized as the most influential and important award for speculative genres for more than 80 years. However, over the course of the award’s history, only a handful of originally non-English works have made the shortlist, and only a single translated novel has won: Cixin Liu’s *The Three-Body Problem*, translated by Ken Liu, in 2015.

We believe that it’s a great time to propose this award, due to the strength and variety of speculative fiction being translated today. A shortlist highlighting diverse and interesting science fiction and fantasy from around the world would deepen conversations within fan communities, boost authors and publishers who are expanding what SF is and does, and benefit the librarians, booksellers, educators, and readers who look to the awards for a record of noteworthy books. And, at a time of rising xenophobia & insularity in the the predominant Worldcon host countries, a Translated Hugo would be a small but potent gesture of inclusion toward the world SF community.

Adding a new Hugo category is an involved process. Like the awards themselves, changes to the Hugo structures and rules are proposed and voted on by members of the World Science Fiction Society. Over the coming months and years, we’ll be drafting and revising our proposal, refining our arguments, and considering objections and other feedback. We may see if an upcoming Worldcon is interested in a trial run of the awards as a Special Hugo, and what kind of conversations and programming we can get going in the meantime.

Ultimately, adding the award on a lasting basis will come down to votes at WSFS business meetings, so we’ll be asking supporters to attend and vote in favor when we get to that point. But, we’re also planning to show that this idea is feasible, that it’s something we can and ought to do, and that it has support among larger fannish and literary communities. We’re going to gather resources that we hope will be useful for interested readers, and demonstrate the viability of the project. We are excited about speculative fiction in translation, and plan to use this project to build on and share that excitement.

So: lots to come, watch this space!
